# spark-streaming-mqtt-with-security

This library helps in integrating any MQTT sources with Spark streaming securely in simple steps to process the events in real-time.

Apache Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Apache Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.

With IoT, Big Data is moving towards more stream oriented as these devices send events at regular intervals (say every second) and they need to be processed in real-time, to detect anomalies, filter events, enrich the data for machine learning, prediction and etc.
